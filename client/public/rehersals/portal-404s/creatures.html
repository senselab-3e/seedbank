            [anthropocentrism]
        </h4>
        <p>
            <i>Massumi: what does anthropocentrism do?</i>
        </p>
        <p>

            “The accusation of anthropomorphism is launched in the name of respecting difference. You’re talking
            about
            animal thought? Animal affects and emotions? Animal desire? Animal creativity? Animal subjectivity even?
            Projection, pure difference-denying projection. Nothing but a lack of respect for the radical
            differences
            between modes of existence— yet another act of anthropocentric domination erasing the difference of the
            “other.”
            Animal politics does not set much store by such critiques. They are still laboring within the
            traditional logic
            according to which the only alternative to mutual exclusion is undifferentiation, in this case in the
            guise of a
            putative projective confusion. This alternative is only hardened by the notion of “radical” difference.



            Such critiques do not take into account the possibility of a logic of ten- dencies that interpenetrate
            without
            blurring. Neither do they take into account the movement of transindividuation creating ever more
            differ- ences,
            in an animal parade of vital variations. They know nothing of the reciprocal presupposition of modes of
            existence in the ceaselessly self- differentiating current of life.” (50-1)

            [tendencies]
        </h4>
        <p>
            <i>Creatureesque: think in terms of tendencies</i>
        </p>
        <p>

            “Tendencies are differentiated by the poles between which their vector stretches: they are defined by
            their
            limits. The logic of mutual inclusion does not prioritarily concern itself with forms, or objects, or
            even
            subjects. Tendency is what feeds it. It is in the interlacing of tendential movements that forms,
            objects, and
            subjects are constituted, in perpetual emergence and continual variation. As Bergson emphasizes,
            tendencies are
            not dis- tinguished from each other in the mutually exclusive manner that forms, objects, and subjects
            distinguish themselves. Tendencies can combine forces without mutually excluding each other. In fact, it
            is
            their vocation to mix. Even though they are logically distinguishable by their polarity and orientation,
            they
            never occur naturally alone. Every situation always acti- vates a mix of them. In every situation, they
            co-occur
            without coalescing. They resonate or interfere with each other, stunt or prolong each other, sap or
            boost each
            other, capture each other or enter into mutually beneficial symbiosis.”
        </p>
        <p>
            “Tendencies are nothing other than the creative movement of the mental pole of nature, “creative”
            because from
            their dynamic interpenetrations emerge qualitative variations. Tendencies, in their “mental” movement,
            consti-
            tute subjectivities-without-a-subject: sheer doings, with no doer behind them—with nothing behind them
            but their
            own forward momentum.” (46)

            [the arena]
        </h3>
        <p>
            Amplification is what the arena of the parliament of creatures beholds. It is in amplification that
            tendencies
            carry on, multiply, and make the space move with their qualities (Manning xx).

            Interpenetration. It does not stop there, however, because as the unruly space of the wild beyond
            contains so
            many creatures, when a tendency is amplified it inevitably crosses other tendencies and their qualities.
            They
            start to interpenetrate. Interpenetration means they “effectively mix without getting mixed up” (Massumi
            46)
            That is, tendencies “’interpenetrate’ in a zone of in- discernibility, all the while remaining logically
            distinct when considered as vectors moving through that zone.” (46)


            survival
            yes, this is an arena of exuberance and intensification, but in that also an arena of survival. It is
            survival
            in the sense of what makes life live, what allows it to continue in the creative advance to live well,
            and maybe
            even better? It involves improvisation continuously, because you never ‘get’ it. Any life that ‘gets’ it
            is
            already the dimming down of a life, refraining its own potential …

        Once fabulation kicks in, animal politics, or plant politics, or whatever sort, becomes a creaturesque
        fabulatory politics. Or rather, it is in fabulation that animals, plants, and all things for that
        matter, become
        creatures in their own right. Fabulation extends the animal politics that might somehow still be tied to
        the
        earth to the cosmos, or rather, cosmos’ in that it engenders a multiverse.

            These creatures that are books, that are texts. That are not merely are meant to be ‘read’, but live lives
            in wild, rhizomatic ways (don’t Deleuze and Guattari give as first example of the rhizome the book?)

            How do they move beyond their given form? What happens when that given form starts taking on those
            movements?

            “You may have wondered why do other animals like the capybaras so much? It seems that every animal like
            hanging out with this friendly creature that looks like a rat-pig hybrid, even crocodiles! The answer
            probably lies in the fact that capybaras are very social animals who often live in groups of 10-20
            individuals. These lovable creatures are the largest rodents in the world, growing to a size of up to 134cm
            and weighing up to 66kg. Capybaras are native to South America and are semi-aquatic mammals that prefer to
            live near bodies of water. In fact, they are excellent swimmers and can avoid predators by staying submerged
            for up to 5 minutes in water. As if that wasn’t enough, they only mate in water. Capybaras seem to be able
            to make friends with any other living creature, and people aren't quite sure why. Regardless of what the
            real cause of this friendship-making ability is, the capybaras range of friends is really impressive.”
