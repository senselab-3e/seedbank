          models of thought imbedded within a language that already creates the micro aggressions that these feelings
          are trying to resist. In a way it is a cry(on) of expression.

        <p>it is not that the term [micro-aggressions] per se is problematic, if it came across like that then that’s
          not right. What I was trying to say is that I feel, after having read quite a lot of articles revolving around
          the subject, that the field is incredibly polarised because it is saturated with identity thinking. So it is
          not too say we can’t engage with it, it was more to caution warning with a term that laden, to move with it
          extra carefully. At the same time I felt some of the examples we mentioned do not move into that field, or
          rather they escape that field precisely because they had a different point of entree or moved in a different
          way. I mean those examples that did not directly concern racial issues and that were more concerned with
          processual thinking and what it would mean to say no in regards to that</p>

        <p>"In a violently poetic text, Lawrence describes what produces poetry: people are constantly putting up an
          umbrella that shelters them and on the underside of which they draw a firmament and write their conventions
          and opinions. But poets, artists, make a slit in the umbrella, they tear open the firmament itself, to let in
          a bit of free and windy chaos and to frame in a sudden light a vision that appears through the
          rent-Wordsworth's spring or Cezanne's apple, the silhouettes of Macbeth or Ahab. Then come the crowd of
          imitators who repair the umbrella with something vaguely resembling the vision, and the crowd of commentators
          who patch over the rent with opinions: communication. Other artists are always needed to make other slits, to
          carry out necessary and perhaps ever-greater destructions, thereby restoring to their predecessors the
          incommunicable novelty that we could no longer see."

          how it feels in the looking up (into the light) and the drips that escape down -- the porosity -- and thinking
          with vacuoles, and also how with leaves, once the water levels have reach a full capacity, they tighten and
          close, so that the water can then drift off --- and then (carrying over from another conversation) the sound
          of water when you open the umbrella and it already has some water on it, so the droplets suddenly shower-off
          (a bit) and that differentiating sound, and how you can play with that, amongst the surplus of the
          already-going-on-rain. >>> and all towards questions around how to carry the multiple capacities for
          opening(s)/closing(s), or leaning (out) or intrinsic temporalities</p>

          yes. because ---- vacuoles + osmotic pressure ; )

          and this is what is happening across the semi-permeable membrane of the vaculuole : )



          \\ // //

          // \\ //

          // // //

          \\ \\


          he zig/zag of osmotic pressure pulls the water inside and outside the vacuole, across the membrane, depending
          on whether inside or outside the cell has the greater water pressure. So the vacuole itself isn't controlling
          the contraction or the expansion - it uses the water's 'already existing forces' (through the osmotic pressure
          exerted on the cell membrane) to provide structural integrity and sustainabillity to the cell (so they don't
          burst).


          it's like the smartest leaky balloon in the world, that is pre-accelerated towards inflation or deflation -
          through the relation of forces (pressure) in disequilibrium, inside and outside its membrane.

          but yes. the zigzag. because that's also the difference - made/felt.


          it's not this thing of making smooth. nor a blender. ridges are kept (or the aspiration that they will stay,
          at least for a little while) so we hopefully don't have to return and make them again, every time. so the
          topography will change and not just the (finer) points. (edited)


          but the Z point. this is interesting too. points not as 'a point' singular -- but maybe Z point as
          singularity(ies) with 'the call' already there and in the middle - outside/inside inside/outside


          or -- there are multiple messages on slack going off! the bells are going off on my computer so I can't stay
          linear here : P


          but vacuoles are a Z point!

          @andrew_m shared on FB about how the accelerationist/accelerationism... and how its maybe a mode, but it's not
          a technique --- or the article says a strategy, but not a tactic. it reproduces a certain tract and frequency,
          but not one that has capacities for invention, or with much speculative pragmatism, or. i don't know. but that
          'affirmative yes' -- and with how 'no is not enough' doesn't have to mean the binary-relation-re-inforcing
          action protest action action or.


          "What's good about accelerationism? And what's bad? I love the ambition and scope. Certainly the
          accelerationists' willingness to challenge leftist orthodoxies is refreshing. I also like how the
          accelerationists demand that we take technology and science seriously. And I also agree that there are
          important tactical uses of accelerationist or otherwise hypertrophic interventions (Eugene Thacker and I have
          referred to them as exploits). Still I see accelerationism essentially as a tactic mistaken for a strategy. At
          the same time this kind of accelerationism is precisely what dot-com entrepreneurs want to see from the left.
          Further, and ultimately most important, accelerationism is paternalistic and thus suffers from the problems of
          elitism and ultimately reactionary politics."</p>

          or how mm mentioned the making of affirmative and also indifferent protest banners. or not 'protest banners',
          but flags (also).... and just. that sometimes it might be fun to play with one particular small group of words
          in our own appropriation of a slogan no longer slogan-ing : P


          zzZ [2:07 PM]

          yes, i think the problem with the no is that it confuses activity for inactivity; like Erin wrote in
          Relationscapes, inactivity is very active. So the problem with a no is for not so much the saying of the no,
          the banners that act the no and the zigzags and detours and everything, but the thought that thinks the no is
          inactive and that tries thereby to halt thought itself, remove it from the act. it ends up in this sort of
          giving up, that emptying out of joy and just despair. I was just rereading some Berardi stuff and there it is
          just so clear what dangers that brings with it



          seeing that my body is too madreado after the move, i'll take the day to rest and read

          b) sponges, different thicknesses/qualities (see what kind be leached up in terms of different colours or
          debris) / c) transluscent layered papers of some kind that can get wet, that can wrap around things maybe, and
          when they dry, make a kind of basic cast


          c) if the weather badly turns, head to the brilliant bar/café we had the first rezonator meeting at (on st.
          catherine at berri uquam) and have a free and wilding conversation about rez/3e/or all perculating appetiting
          etc. (edited)</p>
