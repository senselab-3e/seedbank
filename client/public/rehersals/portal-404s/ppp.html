          <strong>Proposition 18 </strong>Give the Gift of Giving<strong><br />
          </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>potlatch </strong> <br />
          <br />
          <em>Generating the Impossible </em>proposes to activate an art event
          that metamodels the resonance between the aesthetic and the
          political through the creation of a qualitative economy of relation.
          It proposes as a metamodeling tool the concept of the gift. For the
          gift to function for this project, it must be understood as a force
          of giving more than as an object of exchange. The event proposes to
          reappropriate the force of giving as a force of life inven-tive of
          new forms. <br />
          <br />
          The subtitle of <em>Generating the Impossible </em>is “a potlatch
          for research- creation.” We take our inspiration here from the
          practice of potlatch of the First Nations peoples of the Pacific
          Northwest coast, a practice that involves a ceremonial period of
          feasting followed by a lavish giving away, and some- times
          destruction, of goods and property.43 Following Marcel Mauss’s
          writings as well as those of Georges Bataille and Jacques Derrida,
          we emphasize that potlatch is a way of modulating the field of
          relation as a function of its limit. What is shared is not so much
          wealth as the limit-idea of gathering, in a manner that counteracts
          the stultifying tendencies of community understood in terms of
          harmony. This is accomplished through an excess of objects of
          exchange and their destruction. The excess of gifts creates
          quasi-chaotic conditions nudging harmony toward polyrhythm. The
          destruction of the gift leaves nothing but the having-given. It
          focuses the experience on the <em>event </em>of giving and its
          iterations and modulations. <br />
          <br />
          Potlatch is a practice for reorienting and remodulating the field of
          exchangeability. This reorienting, as Mauss points out, involves a
          giving of “a part of one’s nature” (1966, 10). We take this not to
          suggest a subject- oriented view of donor and receiver, but as an
          acknowledgement that what connects the social group is the sharing
          of the more-than of their individual subjectivities in the context
          of a ritual technique of hospitality and event-based generosity.<br />
          <br />
          What is given, Mauss adds, is not inert (1966, 9). What is given is
          the gift of giving itself, replete with resettings of the conditions
          for emergence of the field of relation. Generosity as ritual
          technique occurs in a field of relation that cannot be reduced to
          the giver as individual, or the object as gift, or even the punctual
          connection between the two in a particular act of giving. Potlatch
          is a giving for the event by the event. It is the setting into
          motion of a platform for relation that activates the potential for
          modes of collaboration, pushing exchangeability to its creative
          limit. In potlatch, giving reorganizes the event-ecology of
          co-composition. <br />
          <br />
          The gift of giving touches the limit. The “last” gift is the limit
          in relation to which to the field of exchangeability maintains its
          rhythm and intensity. In potlatch, giving reorients the field of
          relations without forcing a complete undermining of the communities’
          modalities of operation. In tribal societies, the gift brings clans
          together for a celebration. The potlatch wards off war by staging an
          activity that, like war, is excessive, but unlike war activates the
          limit of the social field without crossing the threshold into
          violence and completely unforeseeable consequences. Ritual plays a
          key role here, creating an experiential space-time that diverges
          from, while still composing with, everyday experience. Without the
          metastability of ritual, without the practices that creatively
          reassess the limit from within the bounds of the event itself, there
          is always a risk that the threshold will be crossed into a different
          field of relation entirely. (The destruction of objects of exchange
          also wards off capitalism by preventing the accumulation of a
          surplus.) The giving of the event is how this technique of relation
          activates emergent comings-together and belongings-together,
          subordinating the categories of donor and receiver to their
          continued co-involvement in a shared process. A gift economy is not
          about the object. It is about Klee’s <br />
          propositions line: the polyrhythmic force of expression that
          sustains and modulates living-together, intuitively resisting
          calculation. <br />
          <br />
          The gift of giving is ineffable, known only in the interruption it
          stages. What it interrupts are tendencies that might move toward a
          crossing of a threshold. This realigns the field of relation by
          repositioning exchange in excess of human-centered reciprocity. The
          gift of giving belongs to excess, immanent excess: a field of
          sociality overfull of its own rhythms and rebeginnings, brimming
          with transindividual concern for the modalities of exchangeability
          it calls forth. <br />
          <br />
          The giving of giving is a ritual of emergent attunement that is a
          technique for reorienting the event of coming-together. It alters
          time. The now of giving is already reorienting in a future- fielding
          of the moment. Giving sets into motion an anticipation of the limit
          that futures the present in the making in such a way as to
          <em>make felt and simultaneously ward off </em>a necessary crossing
          of a threshold—in a kind of preemptive politics. <br />
          <br />
          To the extent that potlatch wards off the crossing of the threshold,
          it ensures a conservative function (in the most basic definition of
          the word, as preserving or sustaining). It has a radicality as well,
          to the extent that it makes intensively felt, as a creative factor,
          the same limit whose crossing it preempts.
          <em>Generating the Impossible </em>means to play the limit of
          artistic activity, in the context in which we work, making felt the
          potential crossing of its threshold—but without prescribing whether,
          when, and in what manner the threshold is to be crossed. The
          decision to cross into a new relational field—which in this case is
          not one of violence but <em>is </em>one of struggle—is not the
          province of the event organizers, or of any individual. It can only
          be a decision <em>for the event by the event </em>in respect of its
          processual autonomy. <br />
          <br />
          <strong>a community without guarantees </strong> <br />
          <br />
          Derrida suggests that the reorienting accomplished by the gift of
          giving— the fielding of the future in the passing present of giving
          itself—must entail an active forgetting, a Nietzschean radical
          undermining of time as memory of a present past (Derrida 1992, 16).
          As Nietzsche writes, “Forgetting is not simply a kind of inertia, as
          superficial minds tend to believe, but rather the active faculty to
          . . . provide some silence . . . to make place for the new . . .
          those are the uses for what I have called an active forgetting”
          (1969, 57–58). A gift economy orients time in an active forgetting
          of the object and exchange as such. <br />
          <br />
          The destruction of the gift in practices of potlatch is often
          misunderstood as simply the destruction of actual objects. While it
          is certainly also a destruction of wealth, the potlatch ritual is
          even more so an active for- getting of the wealth itself through a
          foregrounding of the event-time of giving. Forgetting activates the
          field of relation in such a way that the emphasis is based no longer
          on the subject–object encounter (and all the forms of ressentiment
          this calls forth) but on the ways in which this singularity of
          expression activates a new kind of collective futurity. For-
          getting, as Maurice Blanchot emphasizes, “ushers in a thought, a
          future, a community without any guarantees.” This ushering is the
          giving itself— not a gift of the past, but a gift for the future—“a
          leap into the unknown” (Ramadanovic 2001). In
          <em>Generating the Impossible</em>, the usher of destruction and
          forgetting will be the free radical. <br />
          <br />
          If forgetting is the condition of giving, the gift is the sign of
          the impossible. As such, it cannot be thought in time. It evades the
          linear time-structure of capitalist economics: the arrow of
          value-adding and accumulation. Instead, it invents a time of the
          not-yet that will have been, a future- anterior in and of the
          relational field of giving. Capitalism, as Joseph Schumpeter
          famously stated, is also about excess and “creative destruction.”
          But it practices forgetting as a kind of inertia. It forgets to
          actively forget, in order always to return to exchange in a way that
          ostensibly makes it all about the object again. The capitalist
          economy continually translates <em>excess </em>relational activity
          into objective <em>surplus</em>. It stockpiles objects and
          instruments of exchange (material and immaterial) for eventual
          turnover, as part of its market pricing mechanisms and investment
          cycles. In order to do this, it is forever requantifying:
          translating the qualities of life associ- ated with objects of
          exchange as found in their emergent field of relation into
          quantitative measures. <br />
          <br />
          As discussed earlier, research-creation participates in both the
          gift alter- economy and the dominant quantitative economy. The art
          market is no different than any other. It translates the excess
          relational activity of research-creation into object-oriented
          surplus, even finding ways to stockpile and quantitatively value
          “ephemeral art.” The prevalence of the concern for new modes of
          documentation and archiving is a sign of the art-economic times.
          Prestige-value, for its part, is ever renascent. The collective
          evaluation at the limit in the model of the gift economy is back-
          grounded, and the vicissitudes of the market itself, its arrow of
          measurable value adding, are foregrounded.<br />
          <br />
          The shift from a gift economy of excess to a quantitative surplus
          <br />
          propositions economy happens when exchange-as-attunement loses its
          desirability. The forgetting that tunes to the anticipatory
          environment of exchange- ability is replaced by the arrow of
          quantitative value-adding. Reterritorial- ized on the art
          institution as annexed to the art market. This dampens the potential
          of artistic activity to create and participate as a force for
          modulating a relational field as a function of the limit and
          threshold. The expressive force of art-work is dulled. It is no
          longer Klee’s line. It is an arrow of objective accumulation: it is
          less force than form. Art too often surrenders its potential to give
          time, to activate forgetting, to create conditions for future
          thinking and doing, becoming.
