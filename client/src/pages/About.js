          1. Entryway (proposition: the gift of process) The entryway responds
          to the need to have a way of inviting people to cross the threshold
          into our space that conveys something of the ethos of the project, and
          familiarizes them with some of the activities under way. The usual
          method of crossing the threshold into a dedicated online space is
          individualizing and transactional: the person identifies themselves,
          often accepts formal conditions, and sometimes provides a fee or
          service in return for gaining entry. Our entryway smart contract, on
          the other hand, is designed to be relational, and to be part of a gift
          economy. The presence of the person entering is not immediately be
          registered in a way that is visible on the platform. They are invited
          basically to lurk: to look around and see what is going on, and then
          to “shadow” a part of the process that interests them. Whenever they
          are ready and feel they have a sense of the process and might have
          something to contribute, they give a gift to the process. This could
          be anything: a comment, a proposition, a concept, a poem, an image, a
          link, a file upload, etc. Once they have made the gift and it is
          registered by the system, their passage across the threshold is
          complete and their presence is made visible.
