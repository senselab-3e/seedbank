They speak in the name of “I” (often masked as “we”) and do their work “according to.” If thresholds are not carefully attended to, interpretation will enter into the encounter, often in the form of self-narration. Before we know it, we will have moved beyond fabulation to mythmaking. Accounts of perceived unacknowledgment will take over. Feeling overlooked, undervalued, ignored, are often the first signs of breakdown. We will find ourselves saying things like “This is how we do things.” These tendencies, which are so typical in group processes, and certainly plague SenseLab, disavow the production of subjectivity in the transindividual constellation of a group-subject. At SenseLab we do our best to move with interpretation when it rears its head, recognizing it as a carryover of the neoliberal tendencies that orient us and the neurotypicality that organizes us. Individualizing is everywhere the norm, and with it comes the he-said-she-said stultifying temporality of interpretation. To practice otherwise can bring with it an acute anxiety that easily turns to what is most familiar. When this happens, we do our best to find another technique for schizzing, trying to become attuned to what created the breakdown in the group-subject. The problem with interpretation as regards schizoanalysis is that it replays the conditions as they have already been reified. In a breakdown of a group process this tends to shifts a group-subject toward subjugation. In this breakdown, it will be second nature to give an account of how the breakdown happened. While this can be both helpful and necessary, the production of the schizz will be backgrounded if this modality of interpretation falls into replaying the theater of individual against individual. Not only will this approach mute the complexity of how the group-subject erupted into dysfunction, it will deny any forces that work transversally, including more-than human forces. The schizz itself will also be muted because its force is precisely that it is transversal, that it operates across."]

//// the export const is KEEYYYYYY because of course then you exporting a specific function within this component. i should probably rename it so the function name and the component are different
//but anyways it works. so again, not export default - -> because that's a react default. i want to reach into this component and grab a single return value from a specific function run by this component
//based on the prop value i pass to it. 

//you can use it by doing import { ArrayOptions } from "./ArrayOptions";


///this fucntion isn't entirely needed --- i can just reach into this component directly, using destructure... { } BUT 
//there may be instances where it clearer to use this and just pass in the prop of the array i want so i'm keeping both options for now
